First needs to import the required libraries

#importing the libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

Then Import the dataset that we are going to be use. Here we used the dataset named 'Crime.csv'

#importing the dataset as 'df'
df = pd.read_csv('Crime.csv')

Now we are going to visualise the Bar Chart

#Visualising the bar chart
#plt.figure(figsize=(10,8), dpi=200)
sns.countplot(data=df, x='Police District Number')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.legend(loc= (1.1,0.51))
